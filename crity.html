          <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
            <p>A problem statement not only defined and narrowed down the project goals and scope, but also kept the design process focused and cohesive.<br>
              I have decided to focus my design based on peoples’ interest in learning through gaming opportunities. This further developed into combining the idea of a travel experience that requires a user to learn about a local area, and a scavenger hunt experience that requires a user to search for hidden objects or spots.<br>
              After some basic research, the problem statement was defined as follows:</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>Gamers, who love travelling, want a fun and exclusive experience that helps them learn about historical facts of a location that is not well known to the public.</h5>
        </div>
        <div>
          The hypothesis was that following guide books can be cumbersome, and walking tours can be restricted by the schedule or weather conditions. Both options also do not deliver the interactive experience a gamer may seek for.
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
              <p>As the idea combines the entertainment aspects of a scavenger hunt game and travelling, and the educational aspects of learning about an area and its history, multiple products and services from different areas were reviewed for the  competitive analysis such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>Game industry focused on scavenger hunts</li>
                  <li>Tourism apps focused on Walking Tours</li>
                  <li>Tour guide books focused on hidden spots/locations in a city</li>
                  <li>Walking Tour Guides</li>
                </ul>
                The following four competitors were reviewed in depth for the competitor analysis that included key objectives, overall strategy, marketing advantages, marketing profile, and a SWOT analysis for each competitor*.

            <h5>Through competitor analysis and market research, it was clear that there was an opportunity to capture both the fun and learning experience through creating an app that guides users to discover and learn about hidden spots within a city at their own pace and convenience.</h5>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>A market analysis for a broader look at the competitive landscape was conducted as well which categorised potential competitors into 6 different competitor types. The following is a quadrant analysis that maps the different competitor types based on two key measurements: entertainment and education, which are the key elements for the app.</p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <ol>
              <li>Tour guide books focused on major tour sites: This is a very competitive space which may deliver a lot of value in the context of learning, but because authors tend to pack in a lot of information related to major tour sites, there is a lack of the fun element. There is also a lack of interactiveness with the reader which would make this option less interesting for gamers.</li>
              <li>Physical walking tours led by tour guides: This is also a very competitive space. While the educational element may be high, the fun element can be dependent on the tour guide. Also, rather than the travellers actively participating on tasks, the information flow is usually one way which makes it less interesting for gamers.</li>
              <li>Walking tour mobile apps: Depending on the app, there is a bit of storytelling to some of these apps which makes it a little bit more interesting and engaging, but primarily the educational aspect is much stronger and the information flow tends to be one way which is from the app to the user. Some of the competitors in this space are VoiceMap, SideWalk, and GPSmyCity.</li>
              <li>Tour guide books focused on hidden spots: There is an element of searching for hidden spots rather than the obvious and famous tourist attractions that may make this option interesting. However, there is a lack of interactiveness which makes it less interesting for gamers.</li>
              <li>Scavenger Hunt Apps that has a focus on tourism: In the sense that these apps target both the gaming and tourism markets, the idea is very similar to this project. However, the apps currently out in the market are mainly focused on quiz solving and team play which minimises the experience of actually learning something. Some of the competitors would be Let’s Roam, CityHunt, and Live the City.</li>
              <li>Scavenger Hunt Apps: As these apps are focused on gaming, there is a strong element of fun and entertainment that is specifically targeted for gamers. However, the goal for these apps are not designed to learn something new which decreases the educational factor. Some of the competitors would be Geocaching and GooseChase.</li>

            <p>Personas were developed using both quantitative data collected from surveys and qualitative information from user interviews.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Survey</h4>
            <p>A user survey was conducted with 26 respondents in total and with interesting differences between the two age groups:</p>

                  <li>81% search information about a question or discovery on the spot when traveling</li>
                  <li>85% uses the GPS when navigating</li>
                  <li>81% have not played a scavenger hunt game when traveling. However, 91% of those respondents said a game would help learn more about the city.</li>

              <p>4 individuals were interviewed, and based on their feedback, an affinity map was created. A total of 7 categories (pink post-its) were created to group the different observations and quotes from the interviews (yellow post-its), which were further synthesised into insights (blue post-its).</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Initial Draft</h4>
            <p>Initial draft of the sitemap was based on the user journey and user flow from the previous phase of the design process. There were 5 main navigation categories: Home, Routes, Profile, Preference Settings, and Info/Help.</p>
          </div>
          <div>

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>However, since the initial draft was based on a hypothesis, an open card sorting was conducted to build the Information Architecture based on how potential users would actually categorise the different elements.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>There were 26 cards in total and the summary of the analysis is as follows:</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Revised Sitemap</h4>
            <p>
              There were multiple revisions to the sitemap with insights based on the card sorting results. One key learning was not only just the importance of a personalised experience but how the labels can reflect such experience.
              <ul>
                <li>“Routes” section became “Favourites” as most participants mentioned bookmarks and downloads related to a personalised experience.</li>
                <li>Route Search Results moved to the same hierarchy as the filters as participants considered both as search functions.</li>
                <li>Users are provided the option to bypass “Favourites” if they wanted to start an audio tour from the route search results.</li>
                <li>Instead of having travel statistic defined as “Profile”, the label changed to “My Trips” to further add the sentiment of personalisation. “Profile” instead became the label for settings as the card sorting results showed that people have a pretty strong association between “Profile” and settings.</li>

            <h4>Final Sitemap</h4>
            <p>Although revisions were results based on the card sorting results, the “Favourites” section required users to click multiple times to reach the audio tour that they have bookmarked or downloaded. Since the audio tour was an essential feature of the app, this was not ideal.
In order to solve this issue, Bookmarks and Downloads were brought one level above to the main navigation which reduces an extra step for the users.</p>
