      <!--the problem section-->
      <div id="cr_problem" class="row container section">
        <h3><span>1</span> &nbsp; The Problem</h3>
        <div class="col-md-50">
          <p>The focus of my design was based on peoples’ interest in learning through gaming opportunities. This developed into combining the idea of one's travel experience and learning about a location, and a scavenger hunt gaming experience that
            requires a user to search for hidden objects or spots.<br>
            Based on research, the problem statement was defined as follows:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-50">
          <h5>Gamers, who love travelling, want a fun and exclusive experience that helps them learn about historical facts of a location that is not well known to the public.</h5><br>
        </div>
        <div id="cr_problem_p" class="indent">
          <p>The hypothesis was that following guide books can be cumbersome, and walking tours can be restricted by schedule or weather conditions. Both options also do not deliver the interactive experience a gamer may seek for.</p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <!--competitor analysis section-->
      <div id="cr_competitors" class="container section">
        <h3><span>2</span> &nbsp; Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <div class="indent">
          <div>
            <p>As the idea combines the entertainment aspects of a gaming and travelling, and the educational aspects of learning about a location, multiple products and services were reviewed for the competitive analysis such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Game industry focused on scavenger hunts</li>
              <li>Tour apps focused on Walking Tours</li>
              <li>Tour guide books focused on hidden spots/locations in a city</li>
              <li>Walking Tour Guides</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following four competitors were reviewed in depth for the competitor analysis that included key objectives, overall strategy, marketing advantages, marketing profile, and a SWOT analysis for each competitor*.</p>

          <div>
            <p>A market analysis was also done where potential competitors were categorized into 6 different competitor types. The following is a quadrant analysis with the different competitor types based on two measurements: entertainment and
              education.</p>

            <h6>Conclusion</h6>
            <p>There were no major discrepancies on the groupings of cards compared to the original site map. However, there was a question of how sections were labelled. For example, instead of “Route”, participants seemed to consider this section
              related to a personalised experience. Revisions were made based on this insight.</p>

          <div class="col-md-50">
            <h4>Revised Sitemap</h4>
            <p>There were multiple revisions to the sitemap with insights based on the card sorting results. One key learning was not only just the importance of a personalised experience but how the labels can reflect such experience.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>“Routes” section became “Favourites” as most participants mentioned bookmarks and downloads related to a personalised experience.</li>
              <li>Route Search Results moved to the same hierarchy as the filters as participants considered both as search functions.</li>
              <li>Users are provided the option to bypass “Favourites” if they wanted to start an audio tour from the route search results.</li>
              <li>Instead of having travel statistic defined as “Profile”, the label changed to “My Trips” to further add the sentiment of personalisation. “Profile” instead became the label for settings as the card sorting results showed that people
                have a pretty strong association between “Profile” and settings.</li>

              <h4>Final Sitemap</h4>
              <p>Although revisions were results based on the card sorting results, the “Favourites” section required users to click multiple times to reach the audio tour that they have bookmarked or downloaded. Since the audio tour was an essential
                feature of the app, this was not ideal.
                In order to solve this issue, Bookmarks and Downloads were brought one level above to the main navigation which reduces an extra step for the users.</p>

                the bookmark or download icon at the bottom navigation bar.</li>
              <li>Once the user bookmarks or downloads a route, the bookmark icon or the download icon on the route card will become bold, confirming the users’ actions. Users can simply tap on the icons again to undo the action.</li>

        <h3><span>11</span> &nbsp; Final Thoughts</h3>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>There is still a lot of room for improvement for this project. The following are the list of things I would have liked to explore had I been given the time:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <ul class="col-lg-50">
            <li><b>Desktop app</b><br>While it made sense to create a mobile app that was intended for users who would be traveling on foot, the card sorting results made it clear that test participants categorised travelling in 3 phases: pre-travel
              planning, during travelling, and post-travel debriefing. Pre-travel and post-travel can potentially involve a lot of browsing, reading, and writing compared to the actual travelling phase. Behaviourally, this could mean users may prefer
              planning and debriefing using their desktops. The hypothesis would need to be researched and tested, but if hypothesis is proven to be true, a desktop app would make sense. There will have to be some consideration of what features to
              include on the desktop app as the actual scavenger hunt features during the travel phase would not be necessary on a desktop.</li>
            <li><b>Filters</b><br>During the usability test there were some interesting suggestions made by some of the participants for the filter options. This includes ideas such as themed routes or recommendations for the best time of a day to
              travel the routes. Personalisation is something I would have liked to focus on had there been more time for the project.</li>
            <li><b>Customisation for the Bookmarks/Downloads pages</b><br>This relates to personalisation as well, but an idea I would like to explore through user testing and surveys would be the option for users to customise folders for the
              “Bookmarks” and “Downloads” pages. This project was focused on the actual travel phase during the scavenger hunt, but it would be insightful to explore the pre-travel and post-travel activities and behaviours of potential users. Folder
              customisation would relate more with the pre-travel planning phase and provide users with the flexibility to organise their preferred routes. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="col-lg-50">
            <li><b>Team play mode</b><br>The “Team Play Mode” is an option on the settings page in the current prototype, but since the focus of the project was more on the process of discovering routes and hidden spots, the prototype was developed
              only for the individual game mode. Providing a team play mode can be a way to monetise the app since it would be a unique feature that other competitor types (i.e. travel books, travel apps, walking tours) do not usually offer. I did
              initially consider charging by the route, but given that other competitor types are already doing this, it made more sense to stick with the idea of monetising from providing a platform for team play rather than the content itself. Had
              there been more time, developing a user flow and prototype for the team play mode is an idea I would have explored. This would have required much more time as the hypothesis would be that there would be different personas to consider,
              since the assumption is that the characteristics of people who travel individually are different from those who prefer group traveling. This also means that a complete different set of user flow, user journey, and information
              architecture under the team play mode would be required.</li>
            <li><b>Accessibility for the visually impaired</b><br>Accessibility for the visually impaired users is an area that needs more improvement on. The app provides text instead of audio based on user settings, which was mainly considered for
              accessibility for the deaf or hard of hearing users. However, given that discovering hidden objects/spots relies on the ability to see, considerations for the visually impaired was not included in the scope of this project. There is
              research to be done on the behaviour, thoughts, and feelings for the visually impaired when travelling which could potentially be an area to explore for this app. </li>
