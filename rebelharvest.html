          <div class="col-md-50">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p>Through research, we understood that roughly one-third of all food produced for human consumption gets lost or goes to waste.  As a team, we have agreed to focus on consumer behaviour and the retail space within the food industry. In order to further narrow down to a specific problem, we each came up with 2~3 problem statements based on research, and each casted 3 votes to finalise and select a problem statement: </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-50">
              <h5>As a consumer, I’d like to get discounts on food that are close to their expiration date and/or may not look perfect. This will help not only save money, but also prevent unnecessary food waste.</h5>

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
              <p>Based on the problem statement of focusing on “close to expired” or  “wonky looking” food, the team decided to identify existing key players in the market for a competitive analysis. Six different competitors were analysed: Sirplus, FoodCloud, Wonky Veg Box, Too Good To Go, Oddbox, and Karma.<br><br>Based on our analysis, we further narrowed down our focus area based on the following assumptions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is more impactful to tackle a production issue  rather than food that has already been used for consumption (i.e. Too Good To Go, Karma). Solving food waste that can impact the production stage means farmers have a better way to predict demand. This translates to a far deeper impact to the entire food supply system cmopared to other stages.</li>
                  <li>Only few of the competitors actually mention the environmental impact of reducing food waste, but even so, they fail to do it in a measurable or relatable way for the users to understand.</li>
                  <li>The hypothesis is that consumers would want to know what is in the food box they have ordered, but most competitors do not disclose the specific items in a box (i.e. Sirplus, Oddbox).</li>
                  <li>The assumption is that if the app facilitates the sense of “community” and “sharing ideas”, it will further motivate users to reduce food waste. Every competitor had some element of “community” in their branding, mainly using social media, but none of them actually had built this as an element of their products.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Feedback & Test Analysis</h4>
            <p>Feedback from the participants were categorised into Observations, Positive Quotes, Negative Quotes, and Errors/Critical Issues. For our iterative design process, due to time constraints, we decided to focus specifically on “Errors/Critical Issues”. However, we also created a backlog documentation in the case we were to revisit the project in the future.</p>

              <p>As part of the iterative design process, there were further changes to the design based on user feedback which included preference tests as well. The following are a couple of the tests that took place that made some significant changes to the design:</p>

          <ul class="col-lg-50">
            <li><b>Desktop app</b><br>While it made sense to create a mobile app that was intended for users who would be traveling on foot, the card sorting results made it clear that test participants categorised travelling in 3 phases: pre-travel planning,  during travelling, and post-travel debriefing. Pre-travel and post-travel can potentially involve a lot of browsing, reading,  and writing compared to the actual travelling phase.  Behaviourally, this could mean users may prefer planning and debriefing using their desktops. The hypothesis would need to be researched and tested, but if hypothesis is proven to be true, a desktop app would make sense. There will have to be some consideration of what features to include on the desktop app as the actual scavenger hunt features during the travel phase would not be necessary on a desktop.</li>
            <li><b>Filters</b><br>During the usability test there were some interesting suggestions made by some of the participants for the filter options. This includes ideas such as themed routes or recommendations for the best time of a day to travel the routes. Personalisation is something I would have liked to focus on had there been more time for the project.</li>
            <li><b>Customisation for the Bookmarks/Downloads pages</b><br>This relates to personalisation as well, but an idea I would like to explore through user testing and surveys would be the option for users to customise folders for the “Bookmarks” and “Downloads” pages. This project was focused on the actual travel phase during the scavenger hunt, but it would be insightful to explore the pre-travel and post-travel activities and behaviours of potential users. Folder customisation would relate more with the pre-travel planning phase and provide users with the flexibility to organise their preferred routes. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="col-lg-50">
            <li><b>Team play mode</b><br>The “Team Play Mode” is an option on the settings page in the current prototype, but since the focus of the project was more on the process of discovering routes and hidden spots, the prototype was developed only for the individual game mode.  Providing a team play mode can be a way to monetise the app since it would be a unique feature that other competitor types (i.e. travel books, travel apps, walking tours) do not usually offer. I did initially consider charging by the route, but given that other competitor types are already doing this, it made more sense to stick with the idea of  monetising from providing a platform for team play rather than the content itself.  Had there been more time, developing a user flow and prototype for the team play mode is an idea I would have explored. This would have required much more time as the hypothesis would be that there would be different personas to consider, since the assumption is that the characteristics of   people who travel individually are different from those who prefer group traveling. This also means that a complete different set of user flow, user journey, and information architecture under the team play mode would be required.</li>
            <li><b>Accessibility for the visually impaired</b><br>Accessibility for the visually impaired users is an area that needs more improvement on. The app provides text instead of audio based on user settings, which was mainly considered for accessibility for the deaf or hard of hearing users. However, given that discovering hidden objects/spots  relies on the ability to see, considerations for the visually impaired was not included in the scope of this project. There is research to be done on the behaviour, thoughts, and feelings for the visually impaired when travelling which could potentially be an area to explore for this app. </li>
